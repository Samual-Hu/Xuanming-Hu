  <h1>My Favourite Food: Hotpot</h1>

  <p>
    Hotpot is one of my favourite foods because it is warm, colourful and very
    social. On a cold day it feels amazing to sit around a boiling pot with
    friends or family, chatting while we cook our own food. I like the spicy
    broth with chilli and pepper, but I also enjoy a mild soup so everyone can
    choose what they like. You can add thin slices of meat, fresh vegetables,
    tofu, mushrooms and noodles. Every person controls their own chopsticks and
    can create a small dipping sauce with sesame, garlic or coriander. For me,
    hotpot is not only a meal, it is a relaxing time to slow down, share stories
    and enjoy simple food together.
